# Portfolio Website

My interactive digital portfolio, showcasing expertise in the Python ecosystem. 
The site is built on the Django framework for powerful server-side development, complemented by a modern, cloud-native architecture using Supabase for PostgreSQL database management, authentication, and API access. 
This setup highlights my proficiency in deploying secure, high-performance web solutions using best-in-class open-source tools.
